This repo details the implementation of a kinematic path planner designed to park three increasingly complex vehicles in a tight space. The vehicles include a delivery robot, a car, and a truck with a trailer, each with distinct steering constraints. A 2D simulated environment with obstacles was created, and configuration space was modeled to account for nonholonomic constraints. Custom path planning algorithms were developed to generate feasible paths that adhere to kinodynamic constraints, guiding each vehicle from the starting position to the target parking spot. The report includes the planned paths and visual snapshots of the parking maneuvers. Although simplistic, this project illustrates automated parking for nonholonomic vehicles in cluttered environments.
